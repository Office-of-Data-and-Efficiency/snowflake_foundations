# About Snowflake and Snowsight

Before beginning the hands-on lab, it is important to understand the platform and interface we will be using.

---

## What Is Snowflake?

Snowflake is a fully managed, cloud-native data platform designed to centralize and analyze data.

It combines:

- Data storage  
- Data processing  
- Data governance  

into a single platform while separating compute and storage so each can scale independently.

Snowflake supports:

- Analytics  
- Data engineering  
- Machine learning  
- Secure data sharing

## What Is Snowsight?

Snowsight is Snowflake’s modern, web-based interface for interacting with the platform.

Through Snowsight, users can:

- Run SQL queries  
- Build Snowpark notebooks  
- Load and manage data  
- Monitor warehouses and query history  
- Administer roles and permissions  

Snowsight provides a unified, browser-based development and administration environment for working with data in Snowflake.

All of the exercises in this lab will be completed using Snowsight.

## Why This Matters

In this lab, you will:

- Load data into Snowflake  
- Query data using SQL  
- Explore data using Snowpark Notebooks  
- Interact with both SQL and Python inside the same platform  

This demonstrates how Snowflake and Snowsight work together to support modern data workflows in a single, integrated environment.
