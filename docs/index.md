# Snowflake Snowsight Application Lab

**Duration:** 90 Minutes  
**Audience:** Internal Technical Training  
**Level:** Foundational

---

## Lab Overview

This hands-on lab introduces the core components of the Snowflake platform and the Snowsight interface through guided, practical exercises.

Participants will work directly inside Snowsight to simulate a real-world data workflow — from environment configuration and data ingestion to querying and interactive exploration.

- Load structured data into a new table  
- Query data using SQL in a worksheet  
- Explore data using Snowpark Notebooks  
- Execute both SQL and Python within the same Snowflake environment  

All exercises are completed directly within Snowsight.
